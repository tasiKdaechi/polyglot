## Requirements
 
- Your flash drive must use the FAT file system. You can check this by right-clicking on your flash drive and selecting Properties. If it is not FAT, you need to format it first.
- Your flash drive must have a Skymedi chip controller. You can check this by using a tool like ChipGenius or Flash Drive Information Extractor. Some common Skymedi chip controllers are SK6211, SK6281, SK6611, SK6621 and SK6625.
- You need to backup your data on your flash drive before using Skymedi Fix. The software will erase all the data on your flash drive during the process.

## Limitations

- The increased capacity is not permanent. If you format your flash drive or use it on another computer, it will revert back to its original capacity.
- The increased capacity may not be compatible with some devices or systems. For example, some media players or game consoles may not recognize your flash drive or may have errors when reading or writing data.
- The increased capacity may reduce the performance and lifespan of your flash drive. The software works by modifying the firmware of your flash drive and changing the allocation unit size. This may cause more wear and tear on your flash drive and make it slower or less reliable.
